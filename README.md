# Bisection Method
In mathematics, the bisection method is a root-finding method that applies to any continuous function for which one knows two values with opposite signs. The method consists of repeatedly bisecting the interval defined by these values and then selecting the subinterval in which the function changes sign, and therefore must contain a root. It is a very simple and robust method, but it is also relatively slow. Because of this, it is often used to obtain a rough approximation to a solution which is then used as a starting point for more rapidly converging methods. The method is also called the interval halving method, the binary search method, or the dichotomy method.
# How to use?
Download the dichotomie.py file, then run the following command:
```python
python3 dichotomie.py
```
# Input:
You should precise the value of Epsilon that you're dealing with, for example
```python
e value: 0.0001
```
# Output:
```python
a= 1.0 b= 2
a= 1.5 b= 2
a= 1.75 b= 2
a= 1.875 b= 2
a= 1.9375 b= 2
a= 1.96875 b= 2
a= 1.984375 b= 2
a= 1.9921875 b= 2
